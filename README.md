Part 1: Directions on using Webstorm

- Step 1: Download Webstorm and Git. 
- Step 2: Open Webstorm and configure the correct path to Git under version control for Git. 
- Step 3: Now you can create a new project.
- Step 4: Create a new file, for example if you want an HTML5 file, click new -> file -> HTML file -> HTML5. 
- Step 5: Start editing your file. Once you are done, click VCS -> import into version control -> create Git repository. 
- Step 6: Commit changes to Git. Click VCS -> Git -> commit file. 
- Step 7: Add the project to Github by clicking VCS -> import into version control -> share project on Github. 
- Step 8: Go on your Github account. You should now see the newly created repository along with the file. 
- Step 9: Remember, first you commit on Git first, then you share on Github. 
  
Part 2: Glossary 

- **Branch**: It is independent from the main repository and allows for creating, listing, renaming, and deleting branches. Essentially, it is a development branch. 
- **Clone**: It points to an exisiting repository and is copied in another location, most likely your local machine.
- **Commit**: This command tracks and saves all your changes. This way, you have a record of each change made along the way. 
- **Fetch**: It retrieves all commits, files, references, or any other data from a repository. 
- **GIT**: The most common version control system, this software makes tracking changes in your files easier along with collaborating. 
- **Github**: This is the provider for the version control system, Git. It allows for collaboration over many groups of people. 
- **Merge**: It merges lines of code into a single branch, leaving the target branch untouched. 
- **Merge Conflict**: Common amongst team collaboration, this conflict arises when two separate branches make edits to the same line in a file, or when one file has been deleted in a branch but edited in another branch. 
- **Push**: This command uploads a local repository to a remote repository. 
- **Pull**: This command combines git fetch and git merge. It updates changes from a remote repository to the current branch. 
- **Remote**: Common repository that team members use. They are a version of your project hosted on the internet. 
- **Repository**: Collection of all your files and history of changes for a project.
